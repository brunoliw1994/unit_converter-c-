# Unit Converter (C++)

To help me with improving my code skills while I'm minoring in Computer Science, I've built this mini-project to sharpen my understanding of programming logic, user interaction, and real-world problem solving. This project helps me improve in writing clean C++ codes using functions, loops, conditionals, and menus.

This Unit Converter is a simple command-line application written in C++. It allows users to convert between different units such as:
- Meters ↔ Feet
- Kilograms ↔ Pounds
- Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit

The user selects a conversion type, enters a value, and receives the result. There is also a **stretch feature** where the user can reverse the conversion direction (e.g. from meters→feet to feet→meters) without restarting the program.

After a reversed conversion is used, the user is asked if they want to continue in reversed mode. If not, the program resets to the normal direction until the user chooses **exit** (option 5).

   I used this to improve how the user interacts with the program.

# Future Work

* Add support for more unit conversions (e.g., liters ↔ gallons)
* Improve the menu design and make it look cleaner
* Save a history of past conversions in a text file
